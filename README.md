# README.md-generator

## Description

This is an application in the terminal to help create a professional README.md file for your next project.

## How to use

To use this application you would need to download all the necessary files that are in this repository. You would also need node.js installed and inquirer installed as well. Once everything is set you would need to run the command `node index.js`. You will be prompted with a series of questions that will be based on your README requirements. Once all questions are answered a file would be created that would be your new README.md file.
